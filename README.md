### Built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM (and love!:heart:).

### What does it do?

* Burger Bracket is a burger joint app that lets users create burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the `New Burger` side of the page waiting to be devoured.

* Each of those burgers also has a `Devour it` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the `Burgers Devoured` area.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
